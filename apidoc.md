#### `GET /api/streams`

##### Response structure

The response from this endpoint provides detailed information about various streams within their categories, structured like the below:

*   **success** (`boolean`): Indicates if the request was successful.
*   **timestamp** (`integer`): Unix timestamp of when the response was generated.
*   **READ\_ME** (`string`): A message prompting interested parties to contact for further API usage details.
*   **performance** (`float`): A performance metric, possibly indicating API response time or efficiency.
*   **streams** (`array`): An array containing objects for different categories:

#### Stream category object

*   **category** (`string`): Name of the category (e.g., "Basketball", "Combat Sports").
*   **id** (`integer`): Unique identifier for the category.
*   **always\_live** (`integer`): Flag to indicate if this category is always live (0 = no, 1 = yes).
*   **streams** (`array`): List of individual stream objects within the category:

#### Stream object

*   **id** (`integer`): Unique identifier for the stream.
*   **name** (`string`): Name or title of the event or stream.
*   **tag** (`string`): A tag or broadcaster label for the stream.
*   **poster** (`string`): URL for the promotional image of the stream.
*   **uri\_name** (`string`): URL-friendly name used in the stream's URI.
*   **starts\_at** (`integer`): Unix timestamp indicating when the stream starts.
*   **ends\_at** (`integer`): Unix timestamp indicating when the stream ends.
*   **always\_live** (`integer`): Indicates if the stream is always live (0 = no, 1 = yes).
*   **category\_name** (`string`): The category name this stream belongs to.
*   **iframe** (`string`): The iframe **you will use to embed**. In this case, contacting specific stream endpoint is not required. If this value isn't present, we have not added it yet.
*   **allowpaststreams** (`integer`): Indicates if past streams are allowed to be viewed (0 = no, 1 = yes).

#### Example response

  `{     "success": true,     "timestamp": 1734299469,     "READ_ME": "Interested in using our API? Contact us for more information.",     "performance": 3.15,     "streams": [       {         "category": "Basketball",         "id": 37,         "always_live": 0,         "streams": [           {             "id": 2940,             "name": "Pelicans at Pacers",             "tag": "Local Broadcast",             "poster": "https://cdn.nba.com/manage/2024/12/nop-@-ind-12_15_2024-game-card-16_9.png",             "uri_name": "nba-reg/week-8/nop-ind",             "starts_at": 1734300000,             "ends_at": 1734310800,             "always_live": 0,             "category_name": "Basketball",             "allowpaststreams": 0           },           // ... Additional streams         ]       },       // ... Additional categories     ]   }`
 

##### Notes

*   The `always_live` and `allowpaststreams` fields are binary indicators where `1` means true and `0` means false.
*   Time-related fields (`starts_at`, `ends_at`, `timestamp`) are in Unix timestamp format.
*   The `uri_name` should be used to construct URLs for accessing specific streams or for API calls related to that stream.

##### Usage

*   Use the `uri_name` to fetch detailed information or access specific streams.
*   For real-time or scheduled streams, ensure your client application can handle timestamp conversions if needed. The ideal timing to poll this endpoint for changes is every **1 minute**.
*   The `poster` URL can be used to display promotional images in user interfaces.

##### Limits

*   **Can** be used on other sites (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*)
*   **Can** be used on a backend/server side generated webpage. Do not poll the endpoint each time your site is loaded. Setup caching within your local application to avoid hammering our API.
*   And **cannot** alter the functionality of our embeds, including advertisements from our embed platform. Infringers will be blocked. Includes sandboxing attempts. We will rape you.
